# ImpidNoFireSpew
Status: Beta

### Description
Its my Impids no fire spew mod for RimWorld, as Impids having ability to todal early bases makes for sucky/frustrating gameplay. Also I went to the RimWorldBase page and it was not there, so it needs backing up somewhere.

### Features
- Currently having compatibility with v1.5-v1.6.
